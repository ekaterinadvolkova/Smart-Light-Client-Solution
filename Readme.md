# Smart Light Client

This product is perfect match for saving energy and monitor consumers' electric devices from one place. The app is built with Swift. To run the app on your platform, please follow the instruction below. The app can be visited using the following link

## Introduction
### What?
Smart Light is an advanced solution to real-time electricuty consumption. We intend to reduce users'  electricuty usage and bills, and stain toward improved energy use by providing solutions based on consumer habits.

### Why?
As the world moves further into the digital era, our consumption of electrical energy has reached a wasteful amount. As a group, we researched about many ways of reducing this figure and how our technical backgrounds could guide us with it. Having experience with IoT appliances before, as well as the opportunities for real-world implementation it provides, we aimed to provide a both software and hardware that can be used in collaboration with our application to reduce electricity usage.

### How?
Using a RaspberryPi, Leds, Gateway and motion sensor, with wi-fi for range detection, we were able to conceive a proximity-triggered smart lighting fixture to show a usage of how hardware could be applied in the improvement of energy preserving. This demo also pledges a perspective future as it can freely be applied to other use cases. For instance, through the RaspberryPi, various home appliances can be smoothly accessed and managed. Moreover, the implementation of simple but efficient electronics for room switching detection would allow diverse and reliable communication improving the automation for the strategic energy cuts.

### Tech.
On our software side, we used web-server to 

data science to drive our analysis from provided datasets of when energy is most consumed and most costly. From this data, we deduce and suggest optimal energy usage (for example, when to turn on and off appliances based on sleep patterns). We also look to provide remote control of appliances through the application and our electrical hardware usage. In addition to all of this, Energify looks to quantify for the average person how much energy they saved (both in terms of money and #trees saved), and finally include an interest-piquing solution in the sense of competing with your friends in a leaderboard-style page.

### Future.
As we look into the future implementations of this application, the potential use cases are perspective. Using smart-home system for all home appliances is exciting. We can make tomorrow greener than today.
